It brings together **three everyday utilities** in one unified dashboard:

- 🌦 **Weather Module:** Displays real-time weather data using the **OpenWeatherMap API**.  
- 💱 **Currency Converter:** Converts INR into USD and EUR using **ExchangeRate.host API**.  
- 💬 **Quote Generator:** Provides a random motivational quote (from **Quotable API** or local fallback).

The project is designed to showcase:
- API integration (live and mock data handling)
- Frontend–Backend communication via Axios
- State management using React hooks
- Professional UI design with clean CSS styling
